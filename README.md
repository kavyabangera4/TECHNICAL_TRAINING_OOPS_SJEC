# Technical Training on OOP Using Java

This repository contains the programs and practice work completed as part of my technical training focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- **Static** keyword: variables, methods, and classes
- **Constructors** and their types
- **Inheritance** and method overriding
- **Interfaces** and implementation
- **Abstract Classes** and abstraction concepts
- **Swing** for building basic GUI applications
- **Exception Handling** using try-catch, throws, and custom exceptions
- **Multithreading** and thread lifecycle
- **Basic Database Connectivity (JDBC)** using **SQLite**

> ðŸ”Œ SQLite was used as the database for all JDBC-related tasks. Make sure you have the SQLite JDBC driver added to your project classpath.

## ðŸ›  VS Code Configuration

To ensure smooth Java development in Visual Studio Code, this project includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with useful configurations such as:

- Java project source path
- Compiler and formatting settings
